# üö® **OWNER BIDDING RESTRICTION IMPLEMENTATION**

## **üìã OVERVIEW**

**Problem Identified:** Task owners could bid on their own tasks, creating conflicts of interest and business logic issues.

**Solution Implemented:** Complete restriction preventing task owners from bidding on their own tasks with comprehensive validation.

---

## **üèóÔ∏è IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **1. Feign Client Interface (TaskServiceClient.java)**
```java
/**
 * Check if a user is the owner of a specific task
 */
@GetMapping("/tasks/{taskId}/owner/{userId}")
boolean isTaskOwner(@PathVariable("taskId") Long taskId, @PathVariable("userId") Long userId);
```

### **2. Fallback Implementation (TaskServiceClientFallback.java)**
```java
@Override
public boolean isTaskOwner(Long taskId, Long userId) {
    log.warn("‚ö†Ô∏è Task Service unavailable - Fallback: Cannot verify task ownership for task {} and user {}", 
            taskId, userId);
    
    // In fallback mode, assume user is NOT the owner to prevent blocking
    // This is safer than allowing potential owner bidding
    log.warn("‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback mode: Assuming user {} is NOT the owner of task {} for safety", userId, taskId);
    return false;
}
```

### **3. Bidding Service Validation (BiddingService.java)**
```java
// üö® OWNER BIDDING RESTRICTION: Prevent task owners from bidding on their own tasks
boolean isTaskOwner = taskServiceClient.isTaskOwner(bid.getTaskId(), bid.getBidderId());
if (isTaskOwner) {
    log.error("‚ùå BLOCKED: User {} (ID: {}) attempted to bid on their own task ID: {}", 
            bid.getBidderEmail(), bid.getBidderId(), bid.getTaskId());
    throw new RuntimeException("Task owners cannot bid on their own tasks. This creates a conflict of interest and is not allowed.");
}

log.info("‚úÖ Owner validation passed: User {} is not the owner of task {}", bid.getBidderEmail(), bid.getTaskId());
```

### **4. Task Service Endpoint (TaskController.java)**
```java
/**
 * Check if a user is the owner of a specific task
 */
@GetMapping("/{taskId}/owner/{userId}")
public ResponseEntity<?> isTaskOwner(@PathVariable Long taskId, @PathVariable Long userId) {
    log.info("üîç Checking if user ID: {} is the owner of task ID: {}", userId, taskId);
    
    try {
        boolean isOwner = taskService.isTaskOwner(taskId, userId);
        
        log.info("‚úÖ Task ownership check completed: User {} {} the owner of task {}", 
                userId, isOwner ? "IS" : "IS NOT", taskId);
        
        Map<String, Object> response = new HashMap<>();
        response.put("taskId", taskId);
        response.put("userId", userId);
        response.put("isOwner", isOwner);
        response.put("message", isOwner ? "User is the task owner" : "User is not the task owner");
        
        return ResponseEntity.ok(response);
        
    } catch (Exception e) {
        log.error("‚ùå Failed to check task ownership for task ID: {} and user ID: {} - Error: {}", 
                taskId, userId, e.getMessage(), e);
        
        Map<String, String> errorResponse = new HashMap<>();
        errorResponse.put("error", "Failed to check task ownership");
        errorResponse.put("message", e.getMessage());
        
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body(errorResponse);
    }
}
```

### **5. Task Service Business Logic (TaskService.java)**
```java
/**
 * Check if a user is the owner of a specific task
 */
public boolean isTaskOwner(Long taskId, Long userId) {
    log.info("üîç Checking if user ID: {} is the owner of task ID: {}", userId, taskId);
    
    Optional<Task> taskOpt = taskRepository.findById(taskId);
    
    if (taskOpt.isEmpty()) {
        log.warn("‚ùå Task not found with ID: {}", taskId);
        return false;
    }
    
    Task task = taskOpt.get();
    boolean isOwner = task.getOwnerId().equals(userId);
    
    log.info("‚úÖ Task ownership check: User {} {} the owner of task {} (Owner ID: {})", 
            userId, isOwner ? "IS" : "IS NOT", taskId, task.getOwnerId());
    
    return isOwner;
}
```

## **üß™ TESTING SCENARIOS**

### **Test Case 1: Task Owner Attempts to Bid (Should FAIL)**
```http
POST /api/bids
Headers: 
  X-User-Id: 5
  X-User-Email: taskowner@email.com
Body:
{
  "taskId": 8,
  "amount": 50.00,
  "proposal": "I'll do my own task for cheap"
}
```

**Expected Response (400 Bad Request):**
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to place bid",
  "message": "Task owners cannot bid on their own tasks. This creates a conflict of interest and is not allowed."
}
```

**Expected Logs:**
```
‚ùå BLOCKED: User taskowner@email.com (ID: 5) attempted to bid on their own task ID: 8
```

### **Test Case 2: Non-Owner Attempts to Bid (Should SUCCEED)**
```http
POST /api/bids
Headers: 
  X-User-Id: 2
  X-User-Email: student2@email.com
Body:
{
  "taskId": 8,
  "amount": 75.00,
  "proposal": "I can complete this task efficiently"
}
```

**Expected Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
  "message": "Bid placed successfully",
  "bidId": 1,
  "amount": 75.00,
  "status": "PENDING",
  "isWinning": true
}
```

**Expected Logs:**
```
‚úÖ Owner validation passed: User student2@email.com is not the owner of task 8
```

### **Test Case 3: Task Ownership Check API**
```http
GET /api/tasks/8/owner/5
```

**Expected Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "taskId": 8,
  "userId": 5,
  "isOwner": true,
  "message": "User is the task owner"
}
```

```http
GET /api/tasks/8/owner/2
```

**Expected Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "taskId": 8,
  "userId": 2,
  "isOwner": false,
  "message": "User is not the task owner"
}
```

## **üîí SECURITY FEATURES**

### **1. Multi-Layer Validation**
- **Bidding Service Level:** Primary validation during bid placement
- **Task Service Level:** Ownership verification endpoint
- **Repository Level:** Database-level authorization methods

### **2. Fallback Safety**
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Prevents system blocking during service unavailability
- **Safe Default:** Assumes user is NOT owner in fallback mode
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Tracks all validation attempts

### **3. Business Logic Protection**
- **Conflict Prevention:** Eliminates owner-bidder conflicts
- **Fair Competition:** Ensures level playing field for all bidders
- **Payment Integrity:** Prevents self-payment scenarios
